# Load the processed resume data from resume_loader.py.

# Convert resume sections into vector embeddings using OpenAI Embeddings.

# Store embeddings in ChromaDB, a lightweight semantic search database.

# Implement a retriever function to find the most relevant resume sections based on a query.

# Ensure embeddings are persisted, so they donâ€™t need to be recreated each time.
